# Feed-Me-Do
FMD is an RSS reader than quietly sits on your desktop for when you're ready to see the latest headlines.

This application was written to replace my usage of Klipfolio Personal Dashboard as Klipfolio hasn't been updated in a very long time and has some irritating issues.

The quality of FMD is to be considered at an alpha level as it wasn't originally going to be released publicly; not much testing has been performed and the UI needs *a lot* of work. I tend to put a lot of work into "me-ware" but these days I'm realising that that isn't a great investment of time, so FMD is the first application that doesn't have an interface that I consider very good in a few places (the Feeds Manager - yikes).

Releases will be made when a decent or useful amount of work has been done.

## Download
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/BootBlock/Feed-Me-Do/releases) section on the right.

### Requirements
FND requires Windows 7 or higher, and .NET 7.0+ to be installed. If .NET isn't installed when launching FMD, it should ask you whether you'd like to download it.
