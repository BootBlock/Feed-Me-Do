# Feed-Me-Do
FMD is an RSS reader that quietly sits on your desktop for when you're ready to see the latest headlines.

This application was written to replace my usage of Klipfolio Personal Dashboard as Klipfolio hasn't been updated in a very long time and has some irritating issues.

The quality of FMD is to be considered at an alpha level as it wasn't originally going to be released publicly; not much testing has been performed and the UI needs *a lot* of work. I tend to put a lot of work into "me-ware" but these days I'm realising that that isn't a great investment of time, so FMD is the first application that doesn't have an interface that I consider very good in a few places (the Feeds Manager - yikes).

Releases will be made when a decent or useful amount of work has been done, and/or I'm aware that other people are actually using it.

## What does Feed-Me-Do look like?
Here's a screenshot of FMD with the Carbon theme, showing a couple of feeds. Any blurriness in the below image is due to GitHub scaling down the image; it looks normal and crisp on your desktop (click on the image to view full-sized).

Cursoring over a feed item will pop up a window showing a summary of the feed article, and clicking on the feed item will open it within the system's default browser or the built-in browser based on Microsoft Edge - depending on your settings.

## Download
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/BootBlock/Feed-Me-Do/releases) section on the right.

### Requirements
FMD requires Windows 7 or higher, and .NET 7.0+ to be installed. If .NET isn't installed when launching FMD, it should ask you whether you'd like to download it.

## Documentation
While there's no real documentation, the [wiki section](https://github.com/BootBlock/Feed-Me-Do/wiki) contains some information that you may find beneficial.
